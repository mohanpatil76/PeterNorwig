                    Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless
                    variations
                    offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours. The Amazon advanced
                    search for
                    [title: teach, yourself, hours, since: 2000 and found 512 such books. Of the top ten, nine are
                    programming
                    books (the other is about bookkeeping). Similar results come from replacing "teach yourself" with
                    "learn" or
                    "hours" with "days."
                    The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, or that
                    programming is
                    somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else. Felleisen et al. give a nod to this trend in
                    their
                    book How to Design Programs, when they say "Bad programming is easy. Idiots can learn it in 21 days,
                    even if
                    they are dummies." The Abtruse Goose comic also had their take.

                    Let's analyze what a title like Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours could mean:

                <ul>
                    <li class="list">
                        <span class="subheadings">Teach Yourself :</span> In 24 hours you won't have time to write
                        several significant
                        programs, and learn from your successes and failures with them. You won't have time to work with
                        an
                        experienced programmer and understand what it is like to live in a C++ environment. In short,
                        you won't
                        have time to learn much. So the book can only be talking about a superficial familiarity, not a
                        deep
                        understanding. As Alexander Pope said, a little learning is a dangerous thing.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list">
                        <span class="subheadings">C++:</span> In 24 hours you might be able to learn some of the syntax
                        of C++ (if you
                        already know another language), but you couldn't learn much about how to use the language. In
                        short, if
                        you were, say, a Basic programmer, you could learn to write programs in the style of Basic using
                        C++
                        syntax, but you couldn't learn what C++ is actually good (and bad) for. So what's the point?
                        Alan Perlis
                        once said: "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth
                        knowing".
                        One possible point is that you have to learn a tiny bit of C++ (or more likely, something like
                        JavaScript or Processing) because you need to interface with an existing tool to accomplish a
                        specific
                        task. But then you're not learning how to program; you're learning to accomplish that task.

                <p>
                    Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it
                    takes
                    about
                    ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music
                    composition,
                    telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and
                    topology.
                    The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a
                    task
                    that
                    is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it,
                    and
                    correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts: even
                    Mozart,
                    who
                    was a musical prodigy at age 4, took 13 more years before he began to produce world-class music. In
                    another
                    genre, the Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a string of #1 hits and an appearance on the
                    Ed
                    Sullivan
                    show in 1964. But they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since 1957, and while
                    they had
                    mass
                    appeal early on, their first great critical success, Sgt. Peppers, was released in 1967.
                    Malcolm Gladwell has popularized the idea, although he concentrates on 10,000 hours, not 10 years.
                    Henri
                    Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) had another metric: "Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst." (He
                    didn't
                    anticipate that with digital cameras, some people can reach that mark in a week.) True expertise may
                    take a
                    lifetime: Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) said "Excellence in any department can be attained only by the
                    labor of
                    a
                    lifetime; it is not to be purchased at a lesser price." And Chaucer (1340-1400) complained "the lyf
                    so
                    short,
                    the craft so long to lerne." Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt "ars longa, vita
                    brevis", which
                    is
                    part of the longer quotation "Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum,
                    iudicium
                    difficile", which in English renders as "Life is short, [the] craft long, opportunity fleeting,
                    experiment
                    treacherous, judgment difficult." Of course, no single number can be the final answer: it doesn't
                    seem
                    reasonable to assume that all skills (e.g., programming, chess playing, checkers playing, and music
                    playing)
                    could all require exactly the same amount of time to master, nor that all people will take exactly
                    the same
                    amount of time. As Prof. K. Anders Ericsson puts it, "In most domains it's remarkable how much time
                    even the
                    most talented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of performance. The 10,000 hour
                    number
                    just
                    gives you a sense that we're talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people
                    would argue
                    are
                    the most innately talented individuals still need to get to the highest level."

                        technically, "the maximal level of performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained
                        automatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of performance can be
                        increased even
                        by highly experienced individuals as a result of deliberate efforts to improve." (p. 366) and
                        "the most
                        effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the
                        particular
                        individual, informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors."
                        (p.
                        20-21) The book Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday Life is an
                        interesting
                        reference for this viewpoint.

                        If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school). This will give you
                        access to
                        some jobs that require credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field,

                        any case, book learning alone won't be enough. "Computer science education cannot make anybody

                With all that in mind, its questionable how far you can get just by book learning. Before my first child
                was
                born, I read all the How To books, and still felt like a clueless novice. 30 Months later, when my
                second child
                was due, did I go back to the books for a refresher? No. Instead, I relied on my personal experience,
                which
                turned out to be far more useful and reassuring to me than the thousands of pages written by experts.
                Fred Brooks, in his essay No Silver Bullet identified a three-part plan for finding great software
                designers:

                Systematically identify top designers as early as possible.
                Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career
                file.
                Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.
                This assumes that some people already have the qualities necessary for being a great designer; the job
                is to
                properly coax them along. Alan Perlis put it more succinctly: "Everyone can be taught to sculpt:
                Michelangelo
                would have had to be taught how not to. So it is with the great programmers". Perlis is saying that the
                greats
                have some internal quality that transcends their training. But where does the quality come from? Is it
                innate?
                Or do they develop it through diligence? As Auguste Gusteau (the fictional chef in Ratatouille) puts it,
                "anyone
                can cook, but only the fearless can be great." I think of it more as willingness to devote a large
                portion of
                one's life to deliberative practice. But maybe fearless is a way to summarize that. Or, as Gusteau's
                critic,
                Anton Ego, says: "Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."
                So go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you
                won't
                change your life, or your real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days. How about
                working hard
                to continually improve over 24 months? Well, now you're starting to get somewhere...

        <h3 class="mainHeadings">Appendix: Language Choice</h3>
        <p>
            Several people have asked what programming language they should learn first. There is no one answer, but
            consider these points:
        <ul>
            <li class="list">
                <span class="subheadings">Use your friends</span>. When asked "what operating system should I use,
                Windows, Unix, or Mac?", my answer is usually: "use whatever your friends use." The advantage you get
                from learning from your friends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or between programming
                languages. Also consider your future friends: the community of programmers that you will be a part of if
                you continue. Does your chosen language have a large growing community or a small dying one? Are there
                books, web sites, and online forums to get answers from? Do you like the people in those forums?
            </li>
            <li class="list">
                <span class="subheadings">Keep it simple</span>. Programming languages such as C++ and Java are designed
                for professional development by large teams of experienced programmers who are concerned about the
                run-time efficiency of their code. As a result, these languages have complicated parts designed for
                these circumstances. You're concerned with learning to program. You don't need that complication. You
                want a language that was designed to be easy to learn and remember by a single new programmer.
            </li>
            <li class="list">
                <span class="subheadings">Play</span>. Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the normal,
                interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key, or "batch" mode, in which you
                only hear the notes after you finish a whole song? Clearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for
                the piano, and also for programming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Given these criteria, my recommendations for a first programming language would be Python or Scheme. Another
        choice is Javascript, not because it is perfectly well-designed for beginners, but because there are so many
        online tutorials for it, such as Khan Academy's tutorial. But your circumstances may vary, and there are other
        good choices. If your age is a single-digit, you might prefer Alice or Squeak or Blockly (older learners might
        also enjoy these). The important thing is that you choose and get started.

            T. Capey points out that the Complete Problem Solver page on Amazon now has the "Teach Yourself Bengali in
            21 days" and "Teach Yourself Grammar and Style" books under the "Customers who shopped for this item also
            shopped for these items" section. I guess that a large portion of the people who look at that book are
            coming from this page. Thanks to Ross Cohen for help with Hippocrates.
